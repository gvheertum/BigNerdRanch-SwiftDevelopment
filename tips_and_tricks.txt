Interesting finds and observations:

- When you want to view details regarding a var, you can use alt-click (described as option-click in the book), this will show a popout with information about the variable (like the type).
- In the menu Help -> Documentation and API reference you can find details regarding the language and libraries.
- Enums are not inheriting from any type by default (unlike .net which inherits from int by default)
- Enums funcs are by default immutable, however you can enalbe this by flagging the function as mutating
- Enums can do a whole lot more then we are used to. In Swift they can have functions, but also different values (like when working with shapes)
