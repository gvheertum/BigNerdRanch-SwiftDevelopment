Interesting finds and observations:

* IDE
- When you want to view details regarding a var, you can use alt-click (described as option-click in the book), this will show a popout with information about the variable (like the type).
- In the menu Help -> Documentation and API reference you can find details regarding the language and libraries.

* General
- For readability numeric values can be split with a 1000 separator (_) -> 9_001
- Naming conventions seem to prefer lowerCamelCase (e.g. enum values, struct properties) 
- Classes and structs allow nesting of other class, struct, enum items
- Swift does not enforce the filename to be equal to the classes nor does it enforce a single class per file

* Enumerations
- Enums are not inheriting from any type by default (unlike .net which inherits from int by default)
- Enums funcs are by default immutable, however you can enalbe this by flagging the function as mutating
- Enums can do a whole lot more then we are used to. In Swift they can have functions, but also different values (like when working with shapes)
- Enums can have associated values. These are set through a constructor-like option when creating the value.
- The associated values cannot be read directly from variables (since they are of the enum type)
- Enums can also have recursion (which requires you to flag the enum or at least the recursive bits as inderect), the compiler otherwise needs to allocate enums in your enum without knowing the depth of the enum tree
- Although enum functions can be quite useful, the full recursion I would prefer doing in classes I think

* Struct
- Structs are initialized by StructName(). The new operator cannot be used.
- Struct funcs are by default not allowed to mutate data, like the enums they need to be flagged as mutating
- Mutating functions on structs can be captured in a variable by using the let structFunc = structname.function. The captured function can be fed a struct of the own type and that function can be called again:
    var p = Person();
    let changeName = Person.changeName; //type = (inout Person) -> (String, String) -> ()
    var changeNameForP = changeName(&p);
    changeNameForP("Harry", "de Testkabouter");
    p.introduce(); //This will update the p object we have (since we parsed a reference)

* Classes
- No mandatory access modifiers (public/private/etc needed) -> Default behavior is internal
- Functions are overriden by adding an override to the function
- Calls to the parent class are done through super.[call]
- Override of set vars cannot be done with a simple override addition
- Final prevents override (unlike .net where override cannot be done if not virtual abstract), swift seems to always allow override unless otherwise specified (where .NET can use the new when no override is possible as a work around)
- Structs are copied by value, so altering a struct in your class will only alter the working copy of that element and not the "original", in the monster example this makes that the town in the main is having the old number of residents, while the town copy in the monster updates the number in the local town. This also explains why you should not use let x = nullable {} to work with structs, since updating values will update them locally in the temp var, not in the original.
- Structs have static funcs, classes have class funcs (and statics). These funcs are not created for each instance of the class, but are shared. Class funcs can be overriden (override class func ...), as long as they are not flagged as final (or when used static, since static cannot be overriden, so static func is functionally equal to final class func). The class/statics cannot be called on instances of the class since they are part of the type and not the instances.
- Constructors are called initializators and are defined by init(properties) { } in the class and struct

* Functional aspects
- Function returns can be written as:
return
{
    (name : String) -> String in
    return "\(greeting), \(name)";
};
 which will return a function taking a string argument and returning a string

Properties and variables
* Lazy properties are properties that are set when called (not on init of the object/struct). This will set the property once (and only once) if the property is called
    lazy var townSize : TownSize =
	{}(); //Note that the {} are required
* The lazy makes the function using it mutating. Using this var from a non-mutating function in a struct will yield an compiler error.
* Swift also allows get{} set{} logic, like .NET for properties
    var prop : Type
    {
        get {}
        set(paramName) {}
    }
Set requires a paramnam, this will allow you to use names that make sense. The notation of the set is a bit differtent due to the requirement of the parametername. Also note that the parameter does not require a type (is inferred from the property)
* Properties support observer functions that are attached to the property and are fired when the property is changed (or at least the set is called, it doesnt check if the value is really changing)
var propName : Type = [xxxx]
{
    didSet(oldpropName)
    {
        //oldpropName contains the property value before the set
        //The function is called after setting, so the propName itself will contain the new value
    }
}
* vars can be flagged as class, making them "staticy", the patern used for the class var is the pattern for lazy eval:
class var myVar : Type
{
    return [xx];
}
* making vars readonly is done on the definition of the var
internal private(set) var myProperty = value; //this defines the property internal and the set private
